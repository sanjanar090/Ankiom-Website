        <p className="text-[16px] max-w-5xl mx-auto text-base">
          Flutter is a UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It offers a rich set of widgets, tools, and APIs to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. With Flutter, you can achieve native performance, hot-reload for rapid development, and a consistent user experience across all platforms. Its single-codebase approach significantly reduces development time and costs.
